                Hello! My name is Helen. I am 45 and live in Perth Western Australia. I run my own business in the Aged
                Care Sector called Compatible Care Nursing Services. I love working - my job is extremely fulfilling. I
                have a husband, two kids who are 10 (Girl) & 7 (Boy) that are my world. My present hobbies are running
                after my two kids. I also attend dance and musical theatre classes as I love to dance and sing. I have a
                passion for IT software and want to learn to create my own programs. I have no formal education in IT
                but a lot of on the job experience.

                Helen’s high score on the leadership test make her a strong candidate to be the group leader. In the
                context of a group project, task management and team member organisation are critical to a successful
                outcome. A particularly high score in ‘Motivating’ is ideal for ensuring the team is consistently

                Being a natural problem solver and decision maker will allow Helen to shine when unforeseen problems

                Hello! My name is Ben, I’m from Perth. I’m a gamer and a musician, and love learning
                about all sorts of new things, especially in the realms of movement
                (parkour, martial arts), philosophy, music, psychology and now, all things IT.
                I love exploring the world around us, and so exploring this digital age and how
                we interact with it is right up my alley. I’m fairly fresh to the field of IT,
                but have had a little experience with HTML and CSS, and have helped to manage and
                maintain wordpress websites.

                friends over a drink in the city, and travelling within Australia and internationally. I have limited

                Hi, my name is John and I’m from Melbourne, Victoria. I have a background in Economics and currently
                work as
                a Web Developer.
                I really enjoy the UI/UX design aspect of building websites. I focus on front-end development, so I am
                particularly confident in my JavaScript and CSS skills.
                The IT world is vast, and I am looking forward to exploring other fields such as machine learning and
                robotics.
                In my free time I enjoy playing guitar in a rock band with friends and hitting the golf course on a
                sunny
                day.

                John’s logical and confident approach will ensure he can work through any task in the assignment. His
                calm and open-minded nature will also enable him to get along well with the other group members and
                hear
                out different ideas.
                <br>
                Taking on tasks in a strategic and organised manner reduces the chance for issues and delays down the
                line, which is useful when working towards a deadline.
