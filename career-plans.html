            While each GS Technologies member’s Ideal Job requires some form of technical expertise with coding, the
            motivations to learn differs amongst team members. Some wish to develop their technical skills to be able to
            help others, and some wish to develop technical skills for their own learning and engagement. Above is a
            graph to summarise and compare GS Technologies Ideal Job skill requirements and interests between GS
            Technologies members.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are commonalities across all ideal jobs - All jobs require some form of programming knowledge, be it
            Front or Back End. Beyond that, there is variety in interests and required skills as shown in the graph
            above. Only one Ideal Job specifically requires an understanding of networking and security, and not all
            jobs listed by GS Technologies Members explicitly mention People Skills, Business Skills or require
            experience with Data Analysis. While all of the Ideal Jobs listed by GS Technology members require some
            Front End programming knowledge, only a few of the jobs require Back End coding knowledge as well. Some of
            the team’s members seek positions requiring a diverse skill set, whereas others are more interested in
            honing their knowledge within a narrower field.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having some common interests within the group will be beneficial in order to relate to one another which
            will be of vital importance in terms of coming to unified group approaches to problem-solving. Conversely,
            the variety between interests of GS Technologies members is also likely to prove beneficial as a team. While
            a democratic approach can slow progress in a team project (especially if perspectives vary too wildly and
            directly contrast one another), a wide range of interests and expertise can ensure that team decisions are
            considered from many angles, and that fewer stones are left unturned (Gaille, 2018), (Wilson, 2020).

              “Software development is still my ideal job. Software is where I feel at home. I understand how to
              read
              data, how to use a system to its fullest and how to push it to provide more. Per the Top Occupations
              for
              year 2018 it is still a highly ranked occupation so I feel that this role would be beneficial. My goal
              is to create the software packages within my own business so I am very dedicated to developing the
              skills to be able to develop and maintain software packages.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would suggest that software development has dropped in ranking for the last 365 days in the Top IT
              jobs as there would have been a need in these higher ranked areas to make software development a
              viable
              role. No use having software if you have no one to service it, to roll out the solution, to see the
              solution through its transitional stages. I also believe that this list is ambiguous as many of these
              roles in one way or another form a part of software development. Clearly the aspect I need to further
              investigate would be what platform of software development do I want to specialise in (eg Java, .Net,
              SQL)
            </p>
            <p>
              SQL is where my interests lie and this is top of the list of IT skills so this would also further
              enhance my resume if I had the ability to become very strong as a software developer using SQL and
              Javascript.
            </p>
            <p>
              In regards to the Generic Skills I feel that I have a strong proven background in many of these skills
              which will only heighten my capabilities”

              “The Burning Glass data could suggest that if I was solely focused on becoming a Senior Systems
              Architect, it could be troublesome to find work as the industry simply does not demand that position.
              However, I trust that such positions will become increasingly important in time, so for now I would
              feel comfortable to maintain a focus on progressing toward the job title while keeping an eye on the
              data as it evolves over the years. As it will take me quite a few years before I have the required
              skill set for my ideal job, I have the opportunity to keep an eye on demand trends as I upskill.
              Aiming for such a senior position, I trust that it will be a ‘shoot for the moon and you’ll land
              amongst the stars’ scenario.”

            <p>
              “Becoming a Senior UX/UI Designer would still be my ideal job. While the job title itself is not
              included in the Top 25 Most In-Demand jobs, many aspects of it are, including Front End Development,
              Graphic Design and UX Design. Due to this, I would have great confidence pursuing this as a career
              without risking ongoing,
              challenging employment issues. There would be many avenues into this job, all of which interest me.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would also think it would be unlikely for jobs like this to decrease in demand over time as it has
              always been an integral job in the process of IT product development. Similarly, I also believe that
              in contrast, it is not a career path that is going to disappear into obscurity either. Therefore,
              ongoing employment would not be at risk so I would be comfortable still proceeding with working
              towards this career as my goal.”

              “The nature of a full stack developer role dictates that expertise across both client and server is
              needed. As such, although the specific role of full stack developer may rank lowly, the individual
              skills required are in high demand on their own.
            </p>
            <p>
              Further to this, I believe having skills across multiple disciplines would be highly attractive to
              employers, as if holes appear in their workspaces, I would be able to be deployed quickly, and without
              the need of training up, or hiring new candidates
            </p>
            <p>
              As this is a far away goal for me, not realistically attainable for at least two or three years with
              constant improvement, I will continue to upskill with confidence that even if the specific role may
              not be in demand, the skills that make it up will be.”

              “I enjoy working on the Front End side of things and am still aiming to secure a position as a Senior
              Front End Developer. However, given the results of the Burning Glass data, it seems that Front End
              skills alone are not as in demand as other related skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              A logical step from Front End Development is to also build out skills in relevant Back End
              technologies. SQL and Java rank highly on the list for Specialist IT skills. These can work
              hand-in-hand with Front End in many projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Interpersonal and team/project management skills are also in high demand. These could be considered as
              necessary for the ‘senior’ positions, as those are not explicitly listed in the Job Titles category.
              Given the improvement of Machine Learning and AI technologies which are finding ways to replace human
              developers on many technical tasks, I also believe a greater emphasis will be placed on IT
              professionals who can interact well with other people.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moving forward I will put more effort into understanding Back End technologies, and building
              interpersonal and team skills in order to better align my career goals with the demand trends.”
