            While each GS Technologies member’s Ideal Job requires some form of technical expertise with coding, the
            motivations to learn differs amongst team members. Some wish to develop their technical skills to be able to
            help others, and some wish to develop technical skills for their own learning and engagement. Above is a
            graph to summarise and compare GS Technologies Ideal Job skill requirements and interests between GS
            Technologies members.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are commonalities across all ideal jobs - All jobs require some form of programming knowledge, be it
            Front or Back End. Beyond that, there is variety in interests and required skills as shown in the graph
            above. Only one Ideal Job specifically requires an understanding of networking and security, and not all
            jobs listed by GS Technologies Members explicitly mention People Skills, Business Skills or require
            experience with Data Analysis. While all of the Ideal Jobs listed by GS Technologies members require some
            Front End programming knowledge, only a few of the jobs require Back End coding knowledge as well. Some of
            the team’s members seek positions requiring a diverse skill set, whereas others are more interested in
            honing their knowledge within a narrower field.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having some common interests within the group will be beneficial in order to relate to one another which
            will be of vital importance in terms of coming to unified group approaches to problem-solving. Conversely,
            the variety between interests of GS Technologies members is also likely to prove beneficial as a team. While
            a democratic approach can slow progress in a team project (especially if perspectives vary too wildly and
            directly contrast one another), a wide range of interests and expertise can ensure that team decisions are
            considered from many angles, and that fewer stones are left unturned (Gaille, 2018), (Wilson, 2020).

          <div class="industry-data-reflection">
            <p>
              “Software development is still my ideal job. Software is where I feel at home. I understand how to read
              data, how to use a system to its fullest and how to push it to provide more. Having a business in Aged
              Care my goal is to create the software packages within my own business so I am very dedicated to
              developing the skills to be able to develop and maintain software packages.
            </p>
            <p>
              Clearly the aspect I need to further investigate would be what platform of software development do I want
              to specialise in (eg Java, .Net, SQL) I will decide this down the track once I have completed and delved
              into more of the programming units.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have created multiple software packages and all I want is to know how to develop them myself. How to
              make the millions of changes and enhancements I think about daily. Currently, I have the luxury of wanting
              the system to do something and making it happen as it is not generic software but my own. This is very
              costly though to pay a developer to make the changes, so I look forward to the future where I can make all
              the modifications and enhancements I desire.

              “Becoming a Senior Systems Architect is an arbitrarily set career goal, but was chosen because the road
              map to becoming a Senior Systems Architect demands a high level of knowledge, and a mix of technical and
              soft skills. Whether or not I become a Senior Systems Architect is somewhat irrelevant - The skills
              required to be one appear to make for strong career opportunities in various parts of the IT industry. I
              choose to focus on becoming a Senior Systems Architect because of the highly employable skills that it
              would provide me with along the way, and not necessarily the job title itself.”

            <p>
              UI/UX design is still my ideal job as I am engaged by the balance of keeping the design user-friendly,
              while considering the technical impact of the design itself. The ability to have a design operate as
              intended without requiring excessive instruction or guidance is often challenging, as we see on many
              websites and mobile device applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              While this job interests me greatly, I am also motivated by salary expectations. There are a large variety
              of incomes ranging from as low as $70,000 to around $120,000 per year. According to Seek, the most common
              salary for User Experience and Interface Designers in Melbourne is $110,000 which leads be to believe this
              is somewhat of a cap, considering that Senior or Lead UI/UX designers are only getting $20-30,000 more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Keeping that in mind, I believe you would need to set yourself apart from the majority of those in this
              field to really advance your career without remaining stagnant in a role. Therefore, I believe a broader
              understanding of the back-end development, rather than front-end would be advantageous. Developing these
              skills along the way through my studies may even alter my opinion on what I consider my ideal career.

              "The nature of a full stack developer role dictates that expertise across both client and server is
              needed. I believe having skills across multiple disciplines would be highly attractive to employers, as if
              holes appear in their workspaces, I would be able to be deployed quickly, and without the need of training
              up, or hiring new candidates. This will also expose me to a range of different roles involved around IT,
              and if I realise that one aspect interests me more than others, I can then focus on that.
            </p>
            <p>
              As this is a far away goal for me, not realistically attainable for at least two or three years with
              constant improvement, I will continue to upskill with confidence that even if the specific role may not be
              in demand, the skills that make it up will be."

              “I enjoy working on the Front End side of things and am still aiming to secure a position as a Senior
              Front End Developer. However, recent trends show that applicants with Front End skills alone are not as in
              demand as those with other related skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              A logical step from Front End Development is to also build out skills in relevant Back End technologies.
              SQL and Java are highly desirable complementary skills that can work hand-in-hand with Front End in many
              projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Interpersonal and team/project management skills are also useful when entering the workforce. These could
              be considered as necessary for more senior positions, as they are often not listed as prerequisites in job
              advertisements. Given the improvement of Machine Learning and AI technologies which are finding ways to
              replace human developers on many technical tasks, I also believe a greater emphasis will be placed on IT
              professionals who can interact well with other people.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moving forward I will put more effort into understanding Back End technologies, and building interpersonal
              and team skills in order to better align my career goals with current trends.”
