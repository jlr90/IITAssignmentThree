            GS Technologies collaborated very well as a group in Assignment Two and we intended to continue our momentum
            into Assignment Three. It was decided that a formal meeting be organised over Zoom to get everyone on the
            same page and working on individual tasks. The meeting was held on July 29th with all members present.
          </p>
          <p>
            We discussed how we would each contribute to the project, and how much time we were able to put in given
            other commitments. We were confident in each other’s reliability and did not anticipate any member becoming
            unexpectedly unresponsive. Tasks and their timeframes were also allocated to each group member, with a focus
            on individual strengths and experience.

            In general, GS Technologies members were satisfied with their efforts and results in Assignment Two. That
            said, each individual member expressed in their reflections that they felt the proofreading could have been
            handled better if it had been specifically allocated to one or more members, rather than picked up by anyone
            who was free to read over sections. This would also allow for everyone to have input in the tone and final
            representation of the Assignment. It was eventually decided that a buddy system would work best, to avoid
            one person feeling the pressure to make sure everyone’s work was at the level required for submission.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given the efficiency and success in using Discord as the primary communication tool for Assignment Two, it
            was decided to continue using Discord for day-to-day communication for Assignment Three. It once again
            proved itself to be an invaluable tool for the group. Discord allowed us to share updates and provide a
            platform for any member to request help if needed. Communication between members occurred almost every day
            over Discord. It also allowed the members to avoid doubling up on tasks as we could ask if anyone had
            started a section first. Finally, given the members of GS Technologies are spread out across the country, it
            removed the scheduling issues of trying to organise meetings across different time zones.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to Discord, a summary of each task as described in the Assignment Three PDF was added to a group
            Smartsheet. We used Smartsheet in Assignment Two as well, however for Assignment Three we broke the tasks
            down in further detail for clarity. This allowed members to quickly reference who was doing what task, what
            tasks had been completed, and what tasks still required attention, without having to organise another
            meeting or contact individual members. It was also an effective way for members to reference the specific
            rubric for the task they were working on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once again, GitHub was the central place for uploading our completed content and hosting the GS Technologies
            website. Each group member also created a name.txt file to document their individual contributions.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the tools mentioned above, as group members completed sections of the assignment, they shared
            them via Google Documents with the other members for proofreading and suggestions. This proved to be a fast
            and easy way to share content and allow more than one member to work on the same piece of content.
          </p>
          <p>
            A HTML/CSS playground was set up for the group to practice web design work on their allocated content. Each
            member has different levels of HTML/CSS capabilities and in Assignment Two, our strongest team member
            handled all the design. The playground was a way for all the team members to have a play with the design of
            their own content. Due to the fact that we are all studying in this field, we felt it would be beneficial to
            each try and increase our skills in this area whilst working on our assignment.
          </p>
          <p>
            A follow-up formal meeting to check group progress and get everyone on the same page, ready for a final push
            to the submission deadline was scheduled for August 16th on Zoom. By this date, members were expected to
            have finished the majority of their assigned tasks to help ensure a smooth and stress-free final week before
            submission. All members were present, and the vast majority of tasks had been completed or were nearing
            completion. Some final decisions were made regarding assignment submission format and other administrative
            details.
