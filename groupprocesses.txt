Group Processes

GS Technologies had a great collaborative effort from all memmbers of the team.  As a group each individual had their own strengths they brought to the table and as a group worked well that when there was an area needing ot be done, someone would jump in an fill it.  There was a sense of comaraderie amongst the group so when one was feeling like they were lacking the rest of the group through positive reinforcement encouraged them to keep going.  

We needed to bring a little more structure into the group for this assignment and have set some new elements to the task at hand.  We had a team meeting at the beginning to recap on Assignment two and discussed how we could improve on this for Assignment 3/5 

Smartsheet worked well in Assignment 2 and we have drilled down further on this and broken it exactly into the assignment requirements.  From here we can allocate a person to each task so we know who is doing what and can keep a running commentary on the status.

We are still using Discord as our main communication hub and this continues to work well.
