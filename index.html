            Hello! My name is Ben, I’m from Perth. I’m a gamer and a musician, and love learning about all sorts
            of new things, especially in the realms of movement (parkour, martial arts), philosophy,
            music, psychology and now, all things IT. I love exploring the world around us, and so exploring
            this digital age and how we interact with it is right up my alley. I’m fairly fresh to the
            field of IT, but have had a little experience with HTML and CSS, and have helped to manage
            and maintain wordpress websites.

            Hi my name is Andrew. I am 26 years old and live in West Gippsland, Victoria. I enjoy catching up with
            friends over a drink in the city, and traveling within Australia and internationally. I have
            limited experience in IT, but have basic knowledge of SQL, HTML, CSS and using the Adobe
            Creative Suite products. I’m looking forward to learning more about Artificial Intelligence
            and Machine Learning, and software development.

          <p>
            Hi, my name is John and I’m from Melbourne, Victoria. I have a background in Economics and currently
            work as a Web Developer. I really enjoy the UI/UX design aspect of building websites. I focus
            on front-end development, so I am particularly confident in my JavaScript and CSS skills.
            The IT world is vast, and I am looking forward to exploring other fields such as machine
            learning and robotics. In my free time I enjoy playing guitar in a rock band with friends
            and hitting the golf course on a sunny day.

            Once again, the members of GS Technologies were able to produce their work to a high standard. The tasks
            were
            distributed evenly and fairly given individual considerations. All members were supportive and ready to help
            out or contribute extra where required.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having a more structured approach to this assignment helped GS Technologies keep track of progress
            throughout
            the assignment. A detailed Smartsheet including each task description and the associated marking rubric
            allowed members to keep on track and ensure the content produced was relevant and accurate. In the group's
            GitHub repository, each member added a name.txt file in order to keep track of the content they had written
            and a log of completed tasks. Updating these files ended up being an extra task to remember, which provided
            no practical benefit towards completing the assignment. As such, contributions to these files were sparse
            and not a good indicator of each member's actual efforts.

          </p>
          <p>
            The initial meeting on Zoom was also an improvement on the group process from assignment two, however it
            could
            have benefited from having an aim to produce an action plan, or at the very least someone taking notes or
            the
            meeting minutes. This is certainly another small detail worth taking forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            The members of GS Technologies also feel it is important to note that much of our success in assignment
            three
            is built off our efforts in producing a high quality assignment two. Each member's contributions across both
            assignments have been vital to the group's continued success.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, the most important factor in GS Technologies' success and ability to overcome or completely avoid
            problems was the constant communication. The group Discord channel was active every day, especially in the
            days leading up to final submission. It also provided a useful resource for referencing past discussions, or
            'pinning' important points or Google Doc links for future reference. Questions were always answered promptly
            with useful input given by multiple group members.
